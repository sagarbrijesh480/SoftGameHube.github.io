        <h1>Super Mario Odyssey: Jump on a cap-tivating, globe-trotting adventure</h1>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Travel across incredible places far from the Mushroom Realm as you dive Mario and his advance ally Cappy on a massive, globe-trotting 3D adventure. Make  use of amazing advance abilities—like the power to capture and control objects, animals, and foes—to pick Power Moons so you can power up the Odyssey airship and save Princess Peach from Bowser’s wedding plans!</h3><br>

        <h3>Thanks to heroic, hat-shaped Cappy, Mario’s got new moves that’ll make you rethink his traditional run-and-leap gameplay—like cap leap, cap throw, and capture. Make use of captured cohorts like foes, objects, and animals to progress through the game and expose loads of unseen collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend, just pass them a Joy-Con controller! Player 1 controls Mario while Player 2 controls Cappy. This sandbox-style 3D Mario adventure—the first since 1996’s your favorite Super Mario 64 and 2002’s Nintendo GameCube classic Super Mario Sunshine—is packed with mystery and surprises, plus thrilling latest Realm to traverse.</h3><br>

        <h3>The first thing that Super Mario Odyssey has going for it is its 3D visuals. The levels in Super Mario Odyssey are designed in a very different way than the 2D levels in previous games of the series. In fact, the game looks like a totally different series. The game’s world is also very different. It’s not just that the levels have been redesigned, but the entire game has been transformed.</h3><br>

        <h3>You play as Mario in Super Mario Odyssey.</h3><br>

        <h3>In Super Mario Odyssey, you’ll go through many stages, which will be full of action-packed moments. In each stage, you’ll have to deal with a variety of enemies. In order to defeat them, you’ll have to perform different moves.</h3>
