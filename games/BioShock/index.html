        <h1>Welcome to Rapture, welcome to terror</h1><br>

        <h3>After reading a lot about this game I was looking forward to test it and I must say I'm still impressed. It makes you feel like you were right in the middle of a terror movie.</h3><br>

        <h3>Bioshock doesn't make things easy for you. First of all, you'll need a high performance computer in order to properly enjoy it. Then, besides hardware requirements, the adventure begins with a terrible airplane accident from which you're the only survivor. Confusion and anguish will seize you while you desperately try to survive. When you finally find a mysterious platform in the middle of the ocean, the real adventure is just about to begin. Bioshock mixes action, terror and puzzles to build a highly elaborated, absorbing plot that will get you hooked.</h3><br>

        <h3>The game is easy to control, with the usual WASD keyboard combination. Regarding graphics, Bioshock justifies its hardware demands by offering an excellent quality and a high level of detail. Music adds the final touch to an action-packed, terror adventure you won't easily forget.</h3><br>

        <h3>BioShock is a shooter unlike any you’ve ever played, loaded with weapons and tactics never seen. You’ll have a complete arsenal at your disposal from simple revolvers to grenade launchers and chemical throwers, but you’ll also be forced to genetically modify your DNA to create an even more deadly weapon: you.</h3>
