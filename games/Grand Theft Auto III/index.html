        <h1>Cool Game for Street Warriors</h1><br>

        <h3>Grand Theft Auto III is the third installment in the Grand Theft Auto series from Rockstar North. The adventure game is based on true-life gang wars, crimes, and corruption in New York City. Players take on various missions spread throughout the game to be able to progress the story.</h3><br>

        <h3>You will take on the role of Claude, a man seeking vengeance on his ex-girlfriend in the fictitious Liberty City, only to become entangled in the criminal underworld. The open-world layout of the game lets you freely roam Liberty City's three islands, and the third-person point of view allows you to better examine your surroundings.</h3><br>

        <h3>I used to be a nice boy. I'd spend Sundays (after choir service) baking cakes with my mum (meringues being my speciality) and I used to own a pink skateboard on which I would stand and go down hills before picking it up and walking back to the top. Girls didn't used to fancy me, they thought I was 'sweet' and I passed all of my '0' Levels with flying colours, barring French.</h3><br>

        <h3>Then at around age 161 discovered fags and booze and started spiralling down the garbage chute of life. Dalliances with drugs did me no favours and now aged 32 I've progressed to mowing down pedestrians, hi-jacking ambulances and ice cream vans, shooting the police, battering vagrants and paramedics and getting taught the ways of the Lord in dark alleys by ladies of ill-repute. The Tories would talk about the gateway theory. The tabloids would probably blame computer games... And for once they'd be right.</h3>
